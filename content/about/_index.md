### About Me

My name is Frank Farach, and I am a data consultant at [Slalom Consulting](https://www.slalom.com/) in Seattle, WA. I love helping people and organizations use data to understand and solve meaningful problems, particularly in healthcare and medical research. I also enjoy programming with data in R, a language I've been using since a fateful encounter in a graduate statistics class in 2004.

Before I became a full-time consultant, I served as a staff scientist, product manager, and program manager at [Prometheus Research](https://prometheusresearch.com), a Connecticut-based informatics company that develops open-source clinical data [registry](https://www.prometheusresearch.com/rexregistry/) [solutions](https://www.prometheusresearch.com/rexstudy/) for biomedical researchers, healthcare providers, and professional medical societies.

Prior to my career in industry, I was a research scientist and postdoc at the [University of Washington](http://www.psych.uw.edu/), and a graduate student in clinical psychology at [Yale University](https://psychology.yale.edu/), where I received a Ph.D. in 2010. For more information about my academic work, please see my [CV](https://github.com/frankfarach/CV/blob/master/CV.md) and [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D3QykOIAAAAJ&hl=en).

In my spare time, I enjoy singing, cycling, recreational math, nonprofit board service, and learning new human and computer languages.

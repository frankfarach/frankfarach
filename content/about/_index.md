## About Me

My name is Frank Farach, and I am a consultant at [Slalom Consulting](https://www.slalom.com/) in the greater Seattle, Washington area. I love helping people and organizations use data to understand and solve meaningful problems, particularly in the healthcare and life sciences industries.

I have long enjoyed programming in functional languages. I've been using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical analysis since 2004, and am the author of `npi`, an [R package](https://github.com/frankfarach/npi) for accessing the U.S. National Provider Identifier Registry. More recently, I've been learning [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), a pure functional language based on [beautiful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) [abstractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory).

Before I became a full-time consultant, I served as a staff scientist, product manager, and program manager at [Prometheus Research, an IQVIA business](https://prometheusresearch.com), a Connecticut-based informatics company that develops open-source clinical data registry solutions for biomedical researchers, healthcare providers, and professional medical societies.

Prior to my career in industry, I was a research scientist and postdoc at the [University of Washington](http://www.psych.uw.edu/), a psycholgy intern providing full-time mental and behavioral healthcare in the [Veterans Health Administration](https://www.va.gov/health/), and a graduate student in clinical psychology at [Yale University](https://psychology.yale.edu/), where I received a Ph.D. in 2010. For more information about my academic work, please see my [CV](https://github.com/frankfarach/CV/blob/master/CV.md) and [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D3QykOIAAAAJ&hl=en).

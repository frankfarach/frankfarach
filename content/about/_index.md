## About Me

My name is Frank Farach, and I am a Senior Consultant at [Slalom Consulting](https://www.slalom.com/) in the greater Seattle, Washington area. I love helping people and organizations use data, information, and knowledge to understand and solve meaningful problems, particularly in the healthcare and life sciences industries.

I have long enjoyed programming with open-source software and contributing to open science. I've been using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical analysis since 2004, and am the author of `npi`, an [rOpenSci-peer-reviewed R package](https://docs.ropensci.org/npi/) for accessing the U.S. National Provider Identifier Registry. My interest in open science led to my involvement with the [Open Science Collaboration](http://osc.centerforopenscience.org/), which included [blog posts](http://osc.centerforopenscience.org/2013/10/25/its-easy-being-green-open-access/) and, ultimately, co-authorship on a [landmark paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716) in Science examining the reproducibility of psychological science research.

Before I became a full-time consultant, I served as a staff scientist, product manager, and program manager at [Prometheus Research, an IQVIA business](https://prometheusresearch.com), a Connecticut-based biomedical informatics company that develops open-source clinical data registry solutions for biomedical researchers, healthcare providers, and professional medical societies.

Prior to my career in industry, I was a research scientist and postdoc at the [University of Washington](http://www.psych.uw.edu/), a psychology intern providing full-time mental and behavioral healthcare in the [Veterans Health Administration](https://www.va.gov/health/), and a graduate student in clinical psychology at [Yale University](https://psychology.yale.edu/), where I received a Ph.D. in 2010.
